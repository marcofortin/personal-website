<h1>My Daughter</h1>
<p>I look forward to the day<br>
    I can finally meet you.<br>
    When I can take you in my arms<br>
    and tell you how much I love you.<br>
    <br>
    I have so many secrets to share with you<br>
    and so much knowledge to give you.<br>
    <br>
    I already feel this connection between us<br>
    which submerges my life with brightness.<br>
    A beautiful smile in the morning<br>
    Joined by an endless good night kiss.<br>
    <br>
    So fragile and innocent<br>
    I want everything for you to be perfect.<br>
    <br>
    I am somehow afraid<br>
    Afraid to expose you.<br>
    We live in an imperfect world<br>
    And I sense the urge to protect you.<br>
    <br>
    This world we live in<br>
    It is not one in which I want you to live.<br>
    <br>
    Delicate as a flower<br>
    I want every other man to see you this way,<br>
    I want you to be treated with respect<br>
    And for you to respect yourself in the same way.<br>
    <br>
    We, men and women, coexists equally<br>
    And no one should ever tell you differently.<br>
    <br>
    You are graceful. You are gorgeous. You are radiant.<br>
    No word can describe your entire beauty.<br>
    You can achieve anything you wish<br>
    Life is at your mercy.<br>
    <br>
    I have this desire that eats me alive<br>
    Where I would be, every day by your side.<br>
    <br>
    Yet, as an ally and a friend<br>
    My intentions are different.<br>
    I wish to raise a proud woman<br>
    One who is independent.<br>
    Even though this is hard for me<br>
    This is the path towards equity.<br>
    <br>
    I dream of waking up one day<br>
    Free from anxiety<br>
    Reassured you can live in a world<br>
    Free of inequality.<br>
    <br>
    Let’s make these dreams reality<br>
    And fight for humanity.<br>

    I dream of a world where every man<br>
    Sees and treats woman the way he sees his daughter.<br>
    With respect, appreciation, dignity and equity<br>
    Like a real man would treat her.<br>
    <br>
    Let’s make all of this together<br>
    And this, for you my daughter.<br>
