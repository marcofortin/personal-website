<h1>Garden of Love</h1>
<p>This delicate garden of flower,<br>
    Offered to us, men<br>
    And always to be desired.<br>
    <br>
    We carelessly ran and ran,<br>
    Disturbing the innocent peace<br>
    Carried by this blossom<br>
    <br>
    Leaving for war,<br>
    We neglected this heaven<br>
    And came back to a fallen nation.<br>
    <br>
    Those flowers,<br>
    they had always been perceived as object of affection<br>
    And never as a gift to open.<br>
    <br>
    We seek in our selfishness a reason,<br>
    A logical explanation<br>
    To our false domination.<br>
    <br>
    However, we we’re too foolish to realise,<br>
    That this gift offered was for us to cherish.<br>
    Not as a property, more as an ally.<br>
    <br>
    I hope for us a better tomorrow,<br>
    A future in which we acknowledge in time<br>
    The authentic power of femininity.<br>
    <br>
    Let’s allow nature’s gift to flourish,<br>
    Let’s stop hampering their growth<br>
    And let’s appreciate their richness.<br>
    <br>
    I speak for men what I say I’m sorry.<br>
    Let’s not forget our past,<br>
    But perhaps build on it towards equity.<br>

</p>
